<h1>Foreign Direct Investment In Malaysia<span style='font-size:100px;'>&#127975;</span></h1> 
This project aims to investigate the flows of foreign direct investment in Malaysia. The dataset consists of 8 columns and 1535 rows. The dataset is obtained from https://data.gov.my/ which contains many kinds of dataset ranging from agriculture to education. We have selected this dataset because we like to know how the impact of foreign direct investment affects the economy of Malaysia. We will perform a series of steps like data processing, data cleaning and visualization on this dataset. Google Colab and Github will be used in this project.<br>
